function [cn, cs] = coeff_solar(delta, param_eq)
% Calculates solar coefficients for a flat plate using Luthcke et al 1997 formula
%Adsorptivity (alpha) + Specular Reflectivity (rho) + Diffuse Reflectivity (delta) = 1
%Transmissivity = 0;
%
% Inputs:
%    param_eq.cR    : Specular reflectivity component
%    param_eq.cD    : Diffuse refelectivity component
%    delta          : Angle between the flow and the surface normal(external) [rad]
%
% Outputs:
%    cn  : normal coefficient [-]
%    cs  : incident coefficient [-]
