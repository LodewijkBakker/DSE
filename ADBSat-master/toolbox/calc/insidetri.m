function flag = insidetri( A, B, C, p )
% Checks if a point falls within the boundary of a triangle.
% Assumes the triangles have been projected onto a 2-dimensional plane,
% and therefore all points have [x,y] coordinates only.
%
% Inputs:
%       A   : 2xN matrix, each column is the [x,y] coordinates of a point of the triangle
%       B   : 2xN matrix, each column is the [x,y] coordinates of the second point of the triangle
%       C   : 2xN matrix, each column is the [x,y] coordinates of the third point of the triangle
%       p   : 2xN matrix, each column is the [x,y] coordinates of a point to be checked for inclusion in the triangle [A,B,C]
%
% Outputs:
%       flag: Vector containing the index of any points which fell inside their respective triangles.
