% Inputs:
%       param_eq.alpha  : Energy accomodation coeffcient [-]
%       param_eq.Tw     : Wall temperature [K]
%       param_eq.Tinf   : Kinetic temperature Ti = V^2/3R 
%       delta           : Angle between the flow and the surface normal(external) [rad]
%
% Outputs:
%       cp      : Pressure coefficient [-]
%       ctau    : Shear stress coefficient [-]
%       cd      : Drag coefficent [-]
